# The Coding Quiz

## Description

Welcome to my Javascript quiz.

Following on from last week's lesson on Web API's, I have created aquiz to test knowledge on JavaScript using (you guessed it) JavaScript. 

## About The Project

More specifically, the task for this challenge was to build a timed quiz with multiple-choice questions using dynamically updated HTML and CSS, powered by JavaScript code.
